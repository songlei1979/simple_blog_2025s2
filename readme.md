# Django Blog Application

This is a simple blog project built with Django. It allows users to create, update, and manage blog posts with images, categories, and snippets.

## üìù PostForm (forms.py)

We use a custom `PostForm` to make the blog post form more user-friendly and styled with Bootstrap.

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Post

class PostForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ["title", "title_tag", "header_image", "body", "snippet", "category"]

        widgets = {
            "title": forms.TextInput(attrs={
                "class": "form-control",
                "placeholder": "Enter the post title"
            }),
            "title_tag": forms.TextInput(attrs={
                "class": "form-control",
                "placeholder": "Enter the SEO title tag"
            }),
            "header_image": forms.ClearableFileInput(attrs={
                "class": "form-control"
            }),
            "body": forms.Textarea(attrs={
                "class": "form-control",
                "rows": 5,
                "placeholder": "Write your post content here..."
            }),
            "snippet": forms.TextInput(attrs={
                "class": "form-control",
                "placeholder": "Enter a short summary (snippet)"
            }),
            "category": forms.Select(attrs={
                "class": "form-control"
            }),
        }
```

### Field explanations
- **title** ‚Üí main post title (text input with Bootstrap styling).  
- **title_tag** ‚Üí meta/SEO title tag for better search engine optimization.  
- **header_image** ‚Üí image upload field with a "Clear" option (thanks to `ClearableFileInput`).  
- **body** ‚Üí main content of the blog post (textarea with 5 rows).  
- **snippet** ‚Üí short summary of the post (used in previews).  
- **category** ‚Üí dropdown list to assign a category.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Views (views.py)

We use Django class-based views with the custom `PostForm`.

### Create a Post
```python
class Post_create(CreateView):
    model = Post
    template_name = "post_create.html"
    form_class = PostForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy("home")

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Assigns an author before saving the post.
        # Currently set to the first user in the database for testing.
        # Replace with: form.instance.author = self.request.user
        form.instance.author = User.objects.first()
        return super().form_valid(form)
```

- Uses `PostForm` for clean Bootstrap styling.  
- Automatically assigns an **author** to the post.  
  - (In production, replace `User.objects.first()` with `self.request.user`).  
- Redirects to `home` after successful creation.

### Update a Post
```python
class Post_update(UpdateView):
    model = Post
    template_name = "post_update.html"
    form_class = PostForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy("home")

    def form_valid(self, form):
        response = super().form_valid(form)
        if self.request.FILES:
            print("Uploaded files:", self.request.FILES)  # Debugging uploaded files
        print("Updated header_image:", form.instance.header_image)  # Debug current image
        return response
```

- Also uses `PostForm` for consistent styling.  
- Prints debug information when files are uploaded.  
- Keeps the old image unless a new one is uploaded or cleared.
